**[github](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MusePose)**    **[huggingface](https://huggingface.co/TMElyralab/MusePose)**    **space (comming soon)**    **Project (comming soon)**    **Technical report (comming soon)**

[MusePose](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MusePose) is an image-to-video generation framework for virtual human under control signal such as pose. 

`MusePose` is the last building block of **the Muse opensource serie**. Together with [MuseV](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseV) and [MuseTalk](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseTalk), we hope the community can join us and march towards the vision where a virtual human can be generated end2end with native ability of full body movement and interaction. Please stay tuned for our next milestone!

We really appreciate [AnimateAnyone](https://github.com/HumanAIGC/AnimateAnyone) for their academic paper and [Moore-AnimateAnyone](https://github.com/MooreThreads/Moore-AnimateAnyone) for their code base, which have significantly expedited the development of the AIGC community and [MusePose](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MusePose).

## Overview
[MusePose](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MusePose) is a diffusion-based and pose-guided virtual human video generation framework.  
Our main contributions could be summarized as follows:
1. The released model can generate dance videos of the human character in a reference image under the given pose sequence. The result quality exceeds almost all current open source models within the same topic.
2. We release the `pose align` algorithm so that users could align arbitrary dance videos to arbitrary reference images, which **SIGNIFICANTLY** improved inference performance and enhanced model usability.
3. We have fixed several important bugs and made some improvement based on the code of [Moore-AnimateAnyone](https://github.com/MooreThreads/Moore-AnimateAnyone).

## News
- [05/27/2024] Release `MusePose` and pretrained models.


## Todo:
- [x] release our trained models and inference codes of MusePose.
- [x] release pose align algorithm.
- [ ] training guidelines.
- [ ] Huggingface Gradio demo.
- [ ] a improved architecture and model (may take longer).


# Getting Started
We provide a detailed tutorial about the installation and the basic usage of MusePose for new users:

## Installation
To prepare the Python environment and install additional packages such as opencv, diffusers, mmcv, etc., please follow the steps below:

### Build environment

We recommend a python version >=3.10 and cuda version =11.7. Then build environment as follows:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### mmlab packages
```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -U openmim 
mim install mmengine 
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.1" 
mim install "mmdet>=3.1.0" 
mim install "mmpose>=1.1.0" 
```


### Download weights
You can download weights manually as follows:

1. Download our trained [weights](https://huggingface.co/TMElyralab/MusePose).

2. Download the weights of other components:
   - [sd-image-variations-diffusers](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers/tree/main/unet)
   - [sd-vae-ft-mse](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse)
   - [dwpose](https://huggingface.co/yzd-v/DWPose/tree/main)
   - [yolox](https://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/v2.0/yolox/yolox_l_8x8_300e_coco/yolox_l_8x8_300e_coco_20211126_140236-d3bd2b23.pth) - Make sure to rename to `yolox_l_8x8_300e_coco.pth`
   - [image_encoder](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-image-variations-diffusers/tree/main/image_encoder)

Finally, these weights should be organized in `pretrained_weights` as follows:
```
./pretrained_weights/
|-- MusePose
|   |-- denoising_unet.pth
|   |-- motion_module.pth
|   |-- pose_guider.pth
|   └── reference_unet.pth
|-- dwpose
|   |-- dw-ll_ucoco_384.pth
|   └── yolox_l_8x8_300e_coco.pth
|-- sd-image-variations-diffusers
|   └── unet
|       |-- config.json
|       └── diffusion_pytorch_model.bin
|-- image_encoder
|   |-- config.json
|   └── pytorch_model.bin
└── sd-vae-ft-mse
    |-- config.json
    └── diffusion_pytorch_model.bin

```
## Quickstart
### Inference
#### Preparation
Prepare your referemce images and dance videos in the folder ```./assets``` and organnized as the example: 
```
./assets/
|-- images
|   └── ref.png
└── videos
    └── dance.mp4
```

#### Pose Alignment
Get the aligned dwpose of the reference image:
```
python pose_align.py --imgfn_refer ./assets/images/ref.png --vidfn ./assets/videos/dance.mp4
```
After this, you can see the pose align results in ```./assets/poses```, where ```./assets/poses/align/img_ref_video_dance.mp4``` is the aligned dwpose and the ```./assets/poses/align_demo/img_ref_video_dance.mp4``` is for debug.

#### Inferring MusePose
Add the path of the reference image and the aligned dwpose to the test config file ```./configs/test_stage_2.yaml``` as the example:
```
test_cases:
  "./assets/images/ref.png":
    - "./assets/poses/align/img_ref_video_dance.mp4"
```

Then, simply run
```
python test_stage_2.py --config ./configs/test_stage_2.yaml
```
```./configs/test_stage_2.yaml``` is the path to the inference configuration file.

Finally, you can see the output results in ```./output/```

##### Reducing VRAM cost
If you want to reduce the VRAM cost, you could set the width and height for inference. For example,
```
python test_stage_2.py --config ./configs/test_stage_2.yaml -W 512 -H 512
```
It will generate the video at 512 x 512 first, and then resize it back to the original size of the pose video.

Currently, it takes 16GB VRAM to run on 512 x 512 x 48 and takes 28GB VRAM to run on 768 x 768 x 48. However, it should be noticed that the inference resolution would affect the final results.

#### Face Enhancement

If you want to enhance the face region to have a better consistency of the face, you could use [FaceFusion](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion). You could use the `face-swap` function to swap the face in the reference image to the generated video.

# Limitations

- Noise and flickering: we observe noise and flicking in complex background.
